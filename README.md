# Portfolio Allocation Analyzer

This project is a web application designed to help users analyze their investment portfolios, particularly focusing on Swiss bank CSV data. It provides detailed breakdowns of asset, currency, country, sector, and domicile allocations, leveraging real-time market data and ETF composition information.

## Features

- **CSV Import**: Upload or paste CSV data from your bank statements.
- **Detailed Portfolio Analysis**: Get a comprehensive overview of your holdings.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Fetches current prices and ETF compositions using a mocked Yahoo Finance API.
- **Allocation Breakdowns**: Visualizes asset, currency, country, sector, and domicile allocations with interactive charts and tables.
- **Swiss Tax Optimization**: Considers tax implications for Swiss investors based on asset domicile.
- **Smart Symbol Resolution**: Attempts to resolve common European ETF and Swiss stock symbols.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or Yarn
- Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-allocation-analyzer.git
    cd portfolio-allocation-analyzer
    \`\`\`
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    \`\`\`bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    \`\`\`
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Yahoo Finance API key:
    \`\`\`
    YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY=YOUR_YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY
    NEXT_PUBLIC_YAHOO_FINANCE_API_BASE_URL=/api/yahoo
    \`\`\`
    *Note: For development, the `NEXT_PUBLIC_YAHOO_FINANCE_API_BASE_URL` is set to proxy through `/api/yahoo` to avoid CORS issues and allow for server-side API calls.*

### Running the Application

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
